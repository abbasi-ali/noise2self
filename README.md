# noise2self
self supervised image denoising

noise2self is a self supervised image denoisation method developed by:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11365

This is a pytorch implementation of the algorithm. This algorithm uses the DnCnn network for the training process. Here is the link to the DnCnn:

noise2self.py is the training code of the project.  

Model2.pt: trained on a subset of the COCO dataset
model-mnist.pt: trained on the MNIST dataset
